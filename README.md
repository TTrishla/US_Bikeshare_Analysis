### In this project, I have written  Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting using descriptive statistics.

### I have created aa script which provide personalise response based on user's input

## 1. Solicit and handle raw user input
## 2. Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user, like user can decide which city, month and weekday data they want to analyise. I have calculated the trends and popular choice for Bike use based on user's input.
